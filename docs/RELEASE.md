# Release & data-safety runbook — arena_ops MVP

Offline-first. Drift/SQLite on the device is the source of truth and there is
no network in the write path. Release builds are **cloud-only**: every write
also lands in a sync outbox that is pushed to Supabase, and other devices'
changes are pulled ([SYNC.md](SYNC.md)). Local mode is for debug builds.

Verified on 2026-10-11: `flutter analyze` clean, `flutter test` **274 passed**.
Since then `bash tool/verify_all.sh` is the one entry point for every
automated check.

## 1. Backups

### Where they are

| Where | What |
|---|---|
| On the device | `<app Documents>/arena_ops-backups/arena_ops-v<schema>-<timestamp>Z.sqlite` (local mode); cloud mode backs up each `arena_ops_cloud_<arena>_<user>.sqlite` the same way, as `arena_ops_cloud_<arena>-v<schema>-<timestamp>Z.sqlite` |
| On this Mac (manual, pre-release) | `~/Documents/arena_ops-backups/` + `MANIFEST.txt` with sha256s |

### How they are taken

`DbSafety.protect` runs **before** the database is opened — from `main()` in
local mode, and from the cloud root before it opens an arena's file — because
Drift migrates the file the instant `AppDatabase` opens it. Each launch:

1. copies `arena_ops.sqlite` **and its `-wal`/`-shm`** aside (the write-ahead log
   holds committed rows the main file has not absorbed yet — a copy without it
   can be missing the last sessions and payments);
2. checkpoints the WAL into the copy, so a backup is one self-contained file;
3. runs `PRAGMA integrity_check` and reads back the row counts of `sessions`,
   `session_segments`, `payments`, `group_sessions`, `group_payments`,
   `bookings`, `customers`, `users`;
4. keeps the copy only if it verified, de-duplicating against an identical
   existing backup;
5. prunes to the newest 10, **never** pruning the newest backup of each distinct
   schema version.

If a migration is pending and no verified backup could be taken, the app
**refuses to open the database** and shows "Data kept safe — app not started"
instead of migrating the only copy. Nothing is changed in that state.

### Restoring

`DbSafety.restore` verifies the backup first, copies the database it is about to
replace aside (`arena_ops-replaced-<timestamp>Z.sqlite`), removes the stale
`-wal`/`-shm` (applying them over a restored file would corrupt it), then puts
the backup in place and re-verifies. A damaged backup is refused rather than
restored over good data.

To restore by hand on a Mac:

```bash
cp ~/Documents/arena_ops-backups/<chosen>.sqlite "<app Documents>/arena_ops.sqlite" && rm -f "<app Documents>/arena_ops.sqlite-wal" "<app Documents>/arena_ops.sqlite-shm"
```

---

## 2. Migrations

`schemaVersion` is **18**. `onUpgrade` walks one step per version boundary
(`_steps[n]` takes v`n` → v`n+1`) and steps must be additive — add a table, a
column or an index, never drop or rewrite user rows.

Before this work, `onUpgrade` **dropped every table** on any version change. It
no longer does. A database older than the oldest declared step has no forward
path and is rebuilt, but only behind the verified backup above, and the rebuild
is recorded in `AppDatabase.rebuiltFromVersion` rather than passing silently.

### Adding a schema change

1. bump `AppDatabase.expectedSchemaVersion`;
2. add the step to `_steps`;
3. add a case to `test/data/local/migration_test.dart` that builds a database in
   the **old** shape, writes a real session + segment + payment into it, opens it
   with the current build and asserts those rows are still correct.

`test/data/local/db_safety_test.dart` guards the framework itself: a gap in the
step chain fails the build, because a gap silently falls through to the rebuild.

---

## 3. Release builds

```bash
flutter test && flutter analyze
```

### Flavors and environments (both platforms)

Every build has a flavor, and each flavor is bound to one environment
(`lib/core/config/app_config.dart`): `dev` → development (local stack or the
offline demo; the default), `staging` → staging (`dart_define.staging.json`,
the personal QA project `arena-ops-staging`), `prod` → production
(`dart_define.prod.json`, the company's project). `AO_ENVIRONMENT` in the define
file must match the flavor. Releases are built with `--flavor staging` or
`--flavor prod` only.

At start `AppConfig.problemFor` checks every build (debug, profile and
release) and shows a configuration error instead of starting when:

* `AO_ENVIRONMENT` does not match the flavor, or `AO_BACKEND` is unknown;
* a dev build is a release, or reaches anything but a development host
  (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `0.0.0.0`, `10.0.2.2`, `::1`, `*.local`,
  `*.localhost`, `*.test`, or plain http);
* a prod build is a debug build;
* a staging / prod build is not cloud mode, misses its URL or key, uses a
  development or non-https host, or a host not listed for its environment in
  `AppConfig.hostedSupabaseHosts`. Both lists are empty until the projects
  exist, so those flavors refuse to start until then — that list is what stops
  a production build from ever pointing at staging;
* the key is a secret (`sb_secret_…`) or `service_role` key, or a legacy anon
  key of a different project than the URL.

Debug builds without defines still run local mode (demo catalog and demo PINs
1111/2222); the demo seed itself refuses to run in a release build.

`dart_define.prod.json` and `dart_define.staging.json` (git-ignored, like every
`dart_define*.json`) hold `AO_BACKEND=supabase`, the project's https URL and
its publishable key — never a secret key ([DEPLOY_SUPABASE.md](DEPLOY_SUPABASE.md)
§0) — plus `AO_ENVIRONMENT` (`production` / `staging`) and `AO_SENTRY_DSN`
(crash reports; see `dart_define.example.json`). Outside production Sentry
records every session (Session Replay) and traces everything; production
records 10 %. Leaving `AO_SENTRY_DSN` empty is allowed but ships without crash
reporting.

### Android

```bash
flutter build apk --release --split-per-abi --flavor prod --dart-define-from-file=dart_define.prod.json
flutter build appbundle --release --flavor prod --dart-define-from-file=dart_define.prod.json
```

(`--flavor staging --dart-define-from-file=dart_define.staging.json` for a QA
build.) Gradle (`android/app/build.gradle.kts`) refuses profile and release
tasks before building when the dart-defines' `AO_ENVIRONMENT` does not match
the flavor, when a staging / prod build lacks `AO_BACKEND=supabase`, for any
dev release, and when `android/key.properties` is missing for a release (§4) —
it never signs a release with the debug key.

Artifacts in `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/` are named per flavor, e.g.
`app-prod-arm64-v8a-release.apk` (any modern Android tablet — **use this
one**), `app-prod-armeabi-v7a-release.apk` (older 32-bit devices). Sizes from
the 2026-10-11 build, before flavors: 24.4 MB / 22.0 MB, fat APK 69.7 MB.

Install on the counter tablet:

```bash
adb install -r build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-prod-arm64-v8a-release.apk
```

**Android NDK.** The build needs NDK `28.2.13676358` because `path_provider_android`
pulls in `jni`, which compiles native code. `sdkmanager` currently crashes trying
to fetch it (`NoSuchFileException`), so it was installed by hand to
`~/Library/Android/sdk/ndk/28.2.13676358` from
`https://dl.google.com/android/repository/android-ndk-r28c-darwin.zip`.

### iOS

```bash
flutter build ios --release --flavor prod --dart-define-from-file=dart_define.prod.json
```

`build/ios/iphoneos/Runner.app` — 24.0 MB (2026-10-11). Bundle id
`in.rorrim.arenaOps` (prod; `.staging` / `.dev` for the other flavors). Each
flavor has an Xcode scheme of the same name and `Debug-` / `Profile-` /
`Release-<flavor>` configurations. Builds clean with `--no-codesign`; signing
needs the Apple developer account (below). The Runner target's "Check
Environment" build phase (`ios/scripts/check_build_environment.sh`) refuses a
profile or release build whose flavor and dart-defines disagree, the same rules
as Gradle. The `Runner` scheme uses the dev configurations (like `dev`), so it
never builds with the production bundle id, and archiving from it is refused.

---

## 4. Signing — the remaining release blocker

Neither platform is signed for distribution yet, pending the developer account.

**Android** release signing comes **only** from `android/key.properties`
(`storeFile`, `storePassword`, `keyAlias`, `keyPassword`; git-ignored). Without
it Gradle refuses the release build instead of signing with the debug key: an
app signed with the debug key **cannot be updated later with a different key**
— it can only ever be replaced by uninstalling it, which deletes the database.
(Builds before this guard were debug-signed, `CN=Android Debug`; replacing one
on a device means uninstalling it.) Before the counter goes live:

1. create the keystore (choose and keep the password; it cannot be recovered, and
   losing it means never being able to update the installed app):

   ```bash
   keytool -genkey -v -keystore ~/arena_ops-upload.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias upload
   ```

2. create `android/key.properties` (git-ignored — never commit it):

   ```
   storeFile=/Users/<you>/arena_ops-upload.jks
   storePassword=<yours>
   keyPassword=<yours>
   keyAlias=upload
   ```

3. rebuild with the release command in §3: `build.gradle.kts` picks the key up
   from `key.properties` by itself.

**iOS** needs the Apple developer account set as the signing team in Xcode
(`ios/Runner.xcworkspace` → Runner → Signing & Capabilities, for the
`Release-prod` and `Release-staging` configurations), then
`flutter build ipa --flavor prod --dart-define-from-file=dart_define.prod.json`.

---

## 5. What is deliberately not in this release

- **Local mode.** A release build never runs the local-only backend, the demo
  catalog or the demo PINs (§3 "Cloud-only").
- The design-only modules with no data model behind them (shift open/close and
  cash drawer, checklists, issue/downtime log, void approval queue, member coins
  and plans) are still absent rather than faked with placeholder numbers.
