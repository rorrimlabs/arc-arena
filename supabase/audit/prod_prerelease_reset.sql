-- Pre-release data reset — production project oilylxydibubupuqghbw
--
-- STATUS: NOT EXECUTED. Prepared 2026-10-22 from supabase/schemas; it has never
-- been run against any database (production, staging or local).
--
-- What it does, in ONE transaction:
--   * removes the activity of the arenas listed in STEP 1 (sessions, groups, bookings,
--     payments, charges, discounts applied, pad allocations and moves, audit log,
--     attendance, leave, salary runs, op log, tombstones; customers unless kept);
--   * 'remove_arena' arenas additionally lose their configuration and people;
--   * deletes the test logins listed in STEP 1, and their staff records;
--   * never touches the schema, migrations, extensions, indexes, functions, RLS
--     policies, grants or any arena / login that is not listed.
-- The append-only guard (payments, charges, audit log, punches, pad moves, …) is
-- lifted for this transaction only and checked back on before commit. Foreign keys
-- stay enforced, so a missed dependency stops the reset instead of orphaning rows.
-- (Never delete under `set session_replication_role = replica`: that also turns off
-- every foreign-key cascade and check, so deleting an arena that way would orphan
-- all of its rows.)
--
-- By default it is a DRY RUN: it performs every step, reports what would go in its
-- error message, and rolls everything back. Only really_delete = true together with
-- confirm_text = 'DELETE PRE-RELEASE DATA' commits.
--
-- ─── RUNBOOK (only after the owner's explicit written approval) ───────────────────
--  1. Inventory: run prod_prerelease_inventory.sql Q0–Q7 in the production SQL
--     Editor; export each result (CSV) outside the repo. Decide, with the owner, which
--     arenas are test (Q2), which mode each gets, and which logins are test (Q3, Q4).
--     Anything not confirmed in writing stays.
--  2. Freeze: uninstall the app from every device used before release (the outbox of
--     an old install would re-push its test operations after the reset), and keep the
--     admin web closed. Pick a quiet window.
--  3. Backup (person with access to the project's organization):
--     a. Dashboard → Database → Backups: note the plan, the newest backup and whether
--        PITR is on. If it lists none, step 3b is the only way back.
--     b. Logical dump outside the repo (needs Docker; the password is typed, never
--        stored; the repo's `--linked` project is the OLD dev project, never use it):
--          mkdir -p ~/arena-prod-backups && chmod 700 ~/arena-prod-backups && cd ~/arena-prod-backups
--          read -rs PW   # database password from the password manager
--          URL="postgresql://postgres.oilylxydibubupuqghbw:$(jq -rn --arg p "$PW" '$p|@uri')@<session-pooler-host>:5432/postgres"
--          supabase db dump --db-url "$URL" --role-only -f roles.sql
--          supabase db dump --db-url "$URL" -f schema.sql
--          supabase db dump --db-url "$URL" --data-only --use-copy -f data.sql
--          unset PW URL
--        (<session-pooler-host>: Dashboard → Connect → Session pooler.)
--     c. Prove it restores, into a THROWAWAY stack, never the arena_ops one:
--          mkdir ~/arena-restore-test && cd ~/arena-restore-test && supabase init
--          (config.toml: project_id = "arena-restore-test", every port +1000)
--          supabase start
--          docker run --rm -v ~/arena-prod-backups:/b postgres:17 psql \
--            "postgresql://postgres:postgres@host.docker.internal:55322/postgres" \
--            --single-transaction -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f /b/roles.sql -f /b/schema.sql \
--            -c 'set session_replication_role = replica' -f /b/data.sql
--        Run inventory Q0 in that stack's Studio and compare with production's Q0
--        (every table, plus auth users). Equal counts = the evidence. Then
--        `supabase stop --no-backup` and delete the folder (it holds personal data).
--  4. Fill in STEP 1 below. Paste the whole file into the production SQL Editor and
--     run it as is (dry run). Read the "DRY RUN" message: every number must match what
--     the owner approved. Re-run inventory Q0/Q1 to confirm nothing changed.
--  5. Real run: set really_delete = true and confirm_text = 'DELETE PRE-RELEASE DATA',
--     run once. The final result lists each table's rows before → after.
--  6. Verify: inventory Q0–Q7 again (Q7 must equal the step-1 baseline except the
--     auth user count), Advisors → Security, supabase/audit/security_audit.sql, then
--     the app checks (owner sign-in, invite → accept, fresh install, sync).
--  After the commit there is no undo except restoring a backup (step 3).
