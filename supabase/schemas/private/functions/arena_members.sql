-- arena_members(arena, since, since_30, search, limit, offset) — one page of the Members screen
--
-- Lives in `private`; clients reach it only through the SECURITY INVOKER wrapper
-- public.arena_members.
--
-- Registered members (walk-in guests left out) matching p_search (part of the
-- name, ignoring case, or digits of the phone; null/blank = all), newest visit
-- first then by name, p_limit (1–200, default 50) from p_offset. Returns
-- {total, rows: [{id, name, phone, birth_year, created_at, visits, minutes,
-- spent_30_paise, last_visit}]}: visits = bills not voided started since p_since
-- (or running); minutes = their play; spent_30_paise = what those started since
-- p_since_30 were billed; last_visit = the later of customers.last_visit_at and
-- the newest such bill's start. SECURITY DEFINER. Caller must be owner level in
-- p_arena (app_is_owner), else 'forbidden'.
-- Client API: callable by signed-in users (authenticated).
