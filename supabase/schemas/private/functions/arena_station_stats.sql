-- arena_station_stats(arena, today, since, to) — per-station figures for the Stations screen
--
-- Lives in `private`; clients reach it only through the SECURITY INVOKER wrapper
-- public.arena_station_stats.
--
-- Returns {station id: {billed_today, sessions_today, minutes_30, billed_30,
-- accessories}} for every station of the arena: billed_* sum the charge lines of
-- bills that were not voided by segment start in [p_today, p_to) / [p_since, p_to);
-- sessions_today counts bills with play on the station started since p_today;
-- minutes_30 the play there since p_since (open play up to now); accessories the
-- accessories homed there that are not retired. SECURITY DEFINER. Caller must be
-- owner level in p_arena (app_is_owner), else 'forbidden'.
-- Client API: callable by signed-in users (authenticated).
