-- arena_staff(arena) — the arena's staff list for the owner dashboard
--
-- Lives in `private`, which the Data API does not expose: SECURITY DEFINER
-- code never sits in an API schema. Clients reach it only through the
-- SECURITY INVOKER wrapper public.arena_staff.
--
-- One jsonb object per staff_profiles row of p_arena: {user_id, name, email,
-- role, perms, active, invited, bills_30d, takings_30d_paise,
-- refunds_30d_paise}. email comes from auth.users (not readable by clients
-- directly); invited = the login has never signed in. The 30-day figures count
-- the payments and refunds (single and group) the member recorded since
-- now() - 30 days: bills = distinct sessions/groups they took a payment for,
-- takings = net paise (payments minus refunds), refunds = paise refunded
-- (positive). Owners first, then by name. SECURITY DEFINER.
-- Caller must be owner level in p_arena (app_is_owner), else 'forbidden'.
-- Client API: callable by signed-in users (authenticated).
