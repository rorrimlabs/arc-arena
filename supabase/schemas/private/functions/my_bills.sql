-- my_bills(arena, day) — the floor app's "My bills": the caller's own closed bills of one day
--
-- Lives in `private`; clients reach it only through the SECURITY INVOKER wrapper
-- public.my_bills.
--
-- The bills (single sessions and groups, completed or voided) the caller started (created_by =
-- auth.uid()) that closed on p_day (IST business date), newest first, as a jsonb array of _sales
-- summaries — the same shape as arena_sales, so op_bill_adjust's rules read off the same fields.
-- Who: bill_edit or bill_record (owners hold both); anyone else 'forbidden'. p_day null →
-- 'invalid_range'.
-- SECURITY DEFINER.
-- Client API: callable by signed-in users (authenticated).
