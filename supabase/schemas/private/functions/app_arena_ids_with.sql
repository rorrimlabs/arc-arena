-- app_arena_ids_with(perms) — arenas where the caller may read sensitive rows
--
-- Lives in `private` (not exposed by the Data API). The membership test for the
-- RLS policies on money, customer and audit tables: the arena_id of every
-- active staff_profiles row of auth.uid() whose role is owner or that holds any
-- of p_any. Policies call it as `arena_id in (select private.app_arena_ids_with(...))`
-- so it runs once per query. Who needs what (direct reads by the dashboard and
-- Realtime Postgres Changes; devices get their data through sync_pull):
--   payments, group_payments, session_charges, group_charges:
--       bill (floor billing) or money / reports (owner level);
--   customers: start or members (check-in, members) or money / reports;
--   audit_log: money / reports (owner level) only.
-- Executable by authenticated because RLS policies run as the caller.
