-- games — the arena's game library
--
-- One row per title the arena offers. Written by op_game_upsert (game.upsert) and
-- op_game_set_active (game.set_active); op_session_start, op_session_reconfigure
-- and group placement bump last_played_at. max_local_players caps the controllers one
-- system may use on this game (players_exceeded otherwise). Per-station
-- availability lives in game_resources, button guides in game_controls.
