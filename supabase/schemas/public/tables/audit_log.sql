-- audit_log — append-only record of sensitive actions and sync-time adjustments
--
-- Written by:
--   op_session_void / op_group_void (entity session / group_session, action void,
--     with the owner's required reason);
--   op_session_end / op_group_end on a waive (action waive, the staff reason when
--     given, before {billed_paise, paid_paise}, after {written_off_paise});
--   op_payment_correct (action payment_correct, the required reason, before
--     {payment_id, method, amount_paise}, after {method, amount_paise, refund_id,
--     payment_id});
--   op_bill_adjust (action bill_adjust, the required reason, before {billed_paise, paid_paise},
--     after {billed_paise, paid_paise});
--   op_customer_create (entity customer, action duplicate_phone_on_sync, when a
--     phone already belongs to another customer and the new row is kept without it).
-- Refunds are not repeated here: each is its own append-only payments row with a
-- reason and who recorded it. Only owner-level members (money / reports) can read
-- it; it has no sync_xid, so it is not part of the sync_pull change feed.

comment on column public.audit_log.arena_id is 'Owning arena (tenant); RLS shows the row only to active members of this arena.';

comment on column public.audit_log.entity_type is 'Kind of row acted on, e.g. session, group_session, customer.';

comment on column public.audit_log.entity_id is 'Id of the row acted on (no FK; entity_type names its table).';
