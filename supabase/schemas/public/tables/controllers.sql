-- controllers — station accessories (game pads, VR headsets, wheels …), tracked by station
--
-- One row per labelled accessory; the dashboard calls them accessories. kind_id
-- (accessory_kinds) says what it is: only pads (no kind, or a kind with
-- counts_as_controller) are allocated to players and borrowed by session starts;
-- the rest are tracked physically (home, location, moves, status) only. home_resource_id is the station it belongs to,
-- current_resource_id where it physically is now. Moving a pad away from home on
-- loan records the return it owes (loan_return_to / loan_session_ref) and appends
-- a controller_moves row. Written by op_controller_upsert / op_controller_set_status
-- (settings), op_controller_move (controller.move) and the borrow step of session
-- and group starts (_pad_borrow); seeded by _seed_arena_catalog. Per-player use is
-- in controller_allocations (at most one open allocation per pad).

comment on table public.controllers is 'Station accessories (pads, headsets, wheels …): label, kind, home station, current location, condition and any outstanding loan.';

comment on column public.controllers.kind_id is 'What the accessory is (accessory_kinds). Null = a game pad. Only pads (null, or a kind with counts_as_controller) can be allocated or borrowed by a session start.';

comment on column public.controllers.arena_id is 'Owning arena (tenant). RLS limits reads to arenas the caller is an active member of.';

comment on column public.controllers.label is 'The marking on the pad (e.g. HEX-1), which staff use to find it.';

comment on column public.controllers.home_resource_id is 'Station the pad belongs to and is returned to. Changed only by a permanent move (re-homing, needs settings).';

comment on column public.controllers.current_resource_id is 'Station where the pad physically is now; equals home_resource_id unless it has been moved.';

comment on column public.controllers.status is 'One of usable, faulty, missing, retired, unavailable. Only usable pads count as free and can be borrowed or allocated. While the arena has any non-retired pad, count-only starts are checked against free pads at the station (_inventory_tracked).';

comment on column public.controllers.notes is 'Why the pad is in its current status (e.g. stick drift).';

comment on column public.controllers.loan_return_to is 'Set while the pad is on loan away from home: the home station id (uuid as text) it must go back to; null otherwise.';

comment on column public.controllers.loan_session_ref is 'Set while on loan: the session that owes the return, as s:<sessionId> or g:<groupId> (app reference string, not a foreign key).';

comment on column public.controllers.sync_xid is 'Id of the transaction that last wrote the row (set by trigger sync_stamp); change-feed cursor for sync_pull.';
