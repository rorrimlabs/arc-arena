-- sync_ops — server-only ledger that makes sync_push apply each device op exactly once
--
-- One row per op id ever pushed, inserted by sync_push after the op's savepoint:
-- applied (with the op's result) or rejected (with error code / detail).
-- Transient failures (serialization, deadlock, lock timeout, cancel) are not
-- recorded, so the device retries them. A re-push of a known op_id replays the
-- stored answer instead of re-running the op. Also the server's receipt time and
-- sender for every op (audit evidence). Server-only: no client grants, and RLS is
-- on with no policies (deny all); only SECURITY DEFINER sync_push touches it.

comment on table public.sync_ops is 'Server-only idempotency ledger for sync_push: one row per device op id with its outcome, replayed on retry. No client grants; RLS on with no policies (deny all).';

comment on column public.sync_ops.payload is 'What an applied configuration, permission or pay op asked for (staff, arena, station types, stations, rates, billing rules, settings, holidays, pricing rules, discounts, shifts, staff holidays, HR profiles, pay rates and rules, salary runs and adjustments, leave adjustments): with user_id and created_at, who changed what and when. Null for floor ops.';

comment on column public.sync_ops.op_id is 'Device-generated op id (outbox key); primary key, so an op is applied at most once. Reuse under another arena raises op_id_reused.';

comment on column public.sync_ops.arena_id is 'Arena the op was pushed to.';

comment on column public.sync_ops.user_id is 'auth.uid() of the signed-in member who pushed the op (no FK).';

comment on column public.sync_ops.device_id is 'Device identifier passed to sync_push, if any.';

comment on column public.sync_ops.kind is 'Op kind dispatched by _sync_apply, e.g. session.start, payment.record; ? if missing.';

comment on column public.sync_ops.status is 'applied or rejected. Retryable failures are never recorded.';

comment on column public.sync_ops.result is 'The op function''s jsonb result when applied; replayed verbatim on a re-push.';

comment on column public.sync_ops.error_code is 'Stable refusal code when rejected (the op''s raised message, e.g. stale or price_mismatch, or a mapped class such as forbidden / duplicate / invalid).';

comment on column public.sync_ops.error_message is 'Refusal detail when rejected (exception hint, else message).';

comment on column public.sync_ops.created_at is 'Server receipt time of the op; audit evidence independent of device clocks.';
