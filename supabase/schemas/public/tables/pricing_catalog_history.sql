-- pricing_catalog_history — recently replaced price lists, for offline devices
--
-- When an op changes the arena's price list (rates, policy, business hours or
-- holidays), _sync_apply stores the previous list here in canonical form
-- (_pricing_canon). session.start / group.create accept a device's pricing
-- snapshot if it equals the live list or one retired within _pricing_grace()
-- (72 h) (_assert_snapshot). Server-only: no RLS policy, no client grants, not
-- synced. One row per distinct list; re-retiring it refreshes retired_at.

comment on table public.pricing_catalog_history is 'Price lists retired by a pricing change, kept so a device that went offline holding the old list can still start sessions within the grace window. Server-only.';

comment on column public.pricing_catalog_history.arena_id is 'Owning arena (tenant). No client access: RLS is enabled with no policy and grants are revoked.';

comment on column public.pricing_catalog_history.canon is 'The retired price list in _pricing_canon form (rates, activities, policy, hours, holidays, closed_days), compared for equality with a device snapshot.';

comment on column public.pricing_catalog_history.retired_at is 'When the list was last replaced (statement time); entries older than _pricing_grace() are no longer accepted.';

comment on column public.pricing_catalog_history.canon_md5 is 'md5 of canon::text (generated). Part of the primary key; lookups match it and then compare canon itself.';
