-- game_resources — per-station availability of each game

-- One row per (game, resource): whether that title can be played there right now.
-- A start, reconfigure or group placement that names a game is refused

-- Written by op_game_set_compat (game.set_compat); seeded by _seed_arena_catalog.
-- Keyed by the pair, so it has no id or created_at. Both ends must be in the
