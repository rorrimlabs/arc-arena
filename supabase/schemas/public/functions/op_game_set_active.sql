-- op_game_set_active — sync op 'game.set_active': archive a game (active false) or restore it.
--
-- Permission: settings.
-- Payload: id, active (true or false).
-- An archived game is hidden from new sessions, bookings and group placements on every device;
-- sessions already playing it keep running, and past bills and bookings keep showing it. The
-- server does not refuse a start on an archived game: a device that was offline when it was
-- archived may already have started one, and refusing would drop a real session from its floor.
-- Setting the flag it already has writes nothing (a retry is a no-op).
-- Checks / errors: forbidden; invalid_payload (hint active); not_found (hint game).
-- Writes: games.active. Returns: {}.
-- Server-only: not executable by anon/authenticated; reached through sync_push.
