-- _pr_charge_key(p_act, p_res, p_cc, p_band, p_start, p_end, ...) — canonical key of one charge row.
--
-- Joins activity, station (or '-'), controller count (or '-'), band, start and end as epoch
-- microseconds, played and billed minutes, unit minutes, unit price and amount with '|'.
-- op_session_end / op_group_end compare sorted arrays of these keys (device charge rows vs the
-- server bill's keys from _pr_keys) as multisets; row ids and order are ignored.
-- Server-only: not executable by anon/authenticated.
