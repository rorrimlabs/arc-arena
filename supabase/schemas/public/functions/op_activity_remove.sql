-- op_activity_remove — sync op 'activity.remove': delete a station type if never used, else retire it.
--
-- Permission: settings.
-- Payload: id.
-- A type no session, group player, charge, pad allocation or booking ever
-- referred to is deleted with its prices and station links (devices get the
-- tombstones). A type with any such history is retired instead (active =
-- false), so past bills keep it. Either way any station mode lock on it is
-- cleared. Idempotent: an id that is already gone returns {removed: 'deleted'}.
-- Checks / errors: forbidden; not_found (hint activity: the id belongs to
-- another arena); activity_has_stations (hint: how many stations that are not
-- disabled still offer it — move or remove them first).
-- Writes: activities (delete or active), resources.current_mode. A price-list
-- change: _sync_apply retires the previous catalog into pricing_catalog_history.
-- Returns: {removed: 'deleted' | 'retired'}.
-- Server-only: not executable by anon/authenticated; reached through sync_push.
