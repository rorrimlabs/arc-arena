-- _payment_status(billed, paid) — payment status of a bill, in paise
--
-- 'paid' when paid >= billed, 'partial' when something but not all is paid,
-- else 'unpaid'. A null billed (no final bill yet) is 'partial' if anything
-- was paid, else 'unpaid'. Used by op_payment, op_session_end and
-- op_group_end ('waived' is decided by the caller, not here).
-- Server-only: not executable by anon/authenticated.
