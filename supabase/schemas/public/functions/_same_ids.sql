-- _same_ids(a, b) — do two uuid arrays hold the same set of ids?
--
-- Compares as sets: order and duplicates are ignored, null counts as empty.
-- Used by op_session_end / op_group_end to check that the segments or
-- assignments the device priced are exactly the ones the server holds.
-- Server-only: not executable by anon/authenticated.
