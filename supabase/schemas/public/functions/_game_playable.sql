-- _game_playable(p_game, p_resource) — refuse a game that is not playable on a station.
--
-- No-op when p_game is null. Raises 'not_playable' (hint: the game_resources status, or
-- 'not_installed' when there is no row) unless the status is 'playable'.
-- Used by op_session_start, op_session_reconfigure and _group_assignable.
-- Server-only: not executable by anon/authenticated.
