///    globally / free here / free elsewhere). Built from the database rows —
///    never from an assumed "2 per station".
///  * [ControllerChoice] — the ONE source of truth for "how many controllers
///    and which ones". In tracked mode the billed count IS the number of picked
///    pads; a requested count the station cannot meet is held as a visible
///    shortfall that blocks Start, never silently shrunk.
///  * [PadSelection.check] — the friendly pre-flight. The repositories still
